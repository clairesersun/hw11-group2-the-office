      <h1 class="main_heading" >Memes All Day</h1>
        <p class="article_content">We’ve all seen them. And we probably all think we’ve seen them all. But we’re wrong, we haven’t. Michael, Dwight, Stanley, Keven…they’re all endlessly quotable, as are the modern memes they’ve inspired. This has impacted the way we communicate today, where if you’re under 30, you know you’ve seen an Office meme in your texts at least a half dozen times.</p>

      <h1 class="main_heading" >Workplace Humor</h1>
        <p class="article_content">Like memes, The Office has provided us with countless blue-collar office-folk jokes. From fake fires to tackle football in the office, everyone wishes they had a boss that could make them laugh as much as Michael Scott. Now, I know “that’s what she said” is a little tired these days, but that humor will lie deep in Office fans forever.</p>

      <h1 class="main_heading" >The Mockumentary-Style and Cringe Humor in TV and Film</h1>
        <p class="article_content">The Office became the most successful mockumentary-style TV show ever made. It went on to inspire sister-like shows such as Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn 99. On ABC, you also had another similar fan favorite that aired a few years later, Modern Family. Additionally, What We Do in The Shadows on Hulu has seen major success. And we can’t forget to thank Reno 911 for paving the way for mockumentaries on TV back in 2003, just a couple of years before The Office made its legendary debut. </p>
